# Welcome!
Hello; I'm Emma! I would like to welcome you to my website!

Please note that this site is basically brand new; so there's for sure going to be a lack of content for a while!

## About me
TL; DR (see the [about page](/about)) for much more information:

I'm a:
 * Blind server administrator (Linux; Debian-based usually) who enjoys hosting many different services and learning about new stuff,
 * Programmer (Python and other basic scripting languages when brain power allows),
 * Musician (piano and drums),
 * and much more!

## Thanks!
Thanks for visiting my website! If you've got any suggestions, please feel free to contact me or check out the [source code for this site](https://github.com/em0gh/em0.wtf)!
