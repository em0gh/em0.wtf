Hello!

My name is Emma or Em (she / her). I'm a transfem living in the united states.

## Trans?
Indeed.

I've recently started my journey. Like many others, I had absolutely no idea I could be trans... Thoughts like "Nah; you're far too much of a dude to do something like that" or "Do you know just how much your family wouldn't approve?"  come to mind.

But here I am!

## Progress so far?
At the time of writing, I've only identified as Emma since November 17 (it's been a week!)! Here's what I know so far (keep in mind I will be constantly updating this section):

### I have not been anywhere near as depressed as I once was.
Like many others, I was very depressed and not happy where my life was going. I recently failed a Cisco networking course because I could not get myself to understand subnetting combined with serious burnout and... Nope! This sent me into months of depression and thinking I wasn't good enough among many, many other issues.

However, since starting my transition I've been feeling much better! I feel I can better express myself, feel much more valued, etc. And I feel like I can actually be creative again!

### I feel I can more relate to my friends now
Literally all (accept for a few) of my friends are trans or something. I always felt like the odd one out. But that feeling of being left out came with something else...

I was unsure what that something else was. Like an emptyness. This would then turn into depression and such, leading to the above issues. I would never write code or mess around with other related projects because I felt like nobody would care. I would never set up new fun things because I felt like nobody would care and it would be a waste of my time. I would sit there for hours (days, really) wondering what was wrong with me. Why I could never fit in. If this depression would ever fuck off!

And... I've found something! I don't yet know how truly effective this is as it's only been a week and getting used to a change like this one is hard for me. Overall I feel so much better, though. I can finally be interested in projects again and can sit down and do things like write this website without the constant feeling of... Never being good enough?

### Final thoughts?
I'd like to thank you for reading my story! I've never been much of a writer (especially about myself). So I hope someone found this valuable in some way.

## Interests
Like the list from the homepage, but with much more stuff in it!

### Technology
I've always been interested in technology from a very young age. I do server administration as a hobby and I am about to go back to school to study cybersecurity. I would also be a Cisco Networking II graduate, but I'm not due to a bunch of issues (see above). But networking (software, usually) is interesting to me too!

#### Servers
I usually run Debian-based servers. They run anything from web servers (for other websites I host) to internal home network stuff (such as PiHole), and I enjoy helping others do the same things.

I try to host as much as possible within Docker containers. I feel it's better that way.

I wouldn't claim to be an expert in any regard; just one who knows how to research if I get stuck.

#### Other Tech
I enjoy all types of other technology, too! This includes (but is most certainly not limited to):
* Music technology. Keyboard's, electronic drums, audio recorders, all sorts!
* Weather Radio's.
* Life Safety equipment (fire and security systems, etc.)


## Thanks for reading!
Please expect this stuff will be updated a lot. This is an ever-growing source of information about me!
