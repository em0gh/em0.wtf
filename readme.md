# em0.wtf

The source code to my Hugo website.

## Building your own version of my site
Couldn't be simpler! Just insure you have Hugo installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/em0gh/em0.wtf.git
cd em0.wtf
hugo
```

That's all there is to it! A very quick static site, that still allows me to write in Markdown and not consider HTML when I just want to write!


Please feel free to report / fix issues and whatnot if you find a typo etc.
